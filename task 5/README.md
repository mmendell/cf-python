hat is object-oriented programming? What are the benefits of OOP?
  MODELS software as a collection of objects. each object can contain its own data, and methods. it allws you to easily bunlde data with methods into one object for repeated use easing up the rewriting part and cleaning the workflow

  2.	What are objects and classes in Python? Come up with a real-world example to illustrate how objects and classes work.

    object would be a singular instance of class. car can be a class, where there would be different makes and models passed in with details assignable such as year make and model. 
    you can create methods to update the car with new details

  3.	In your own words, write brief explanations of the following OOP concepts; 100 to 200 words per method is fine. 

  inheriitance
  you cna create a parent class with set attributes that would pass down to the next created class. for example you could create organisms as a class that would be inherited to another one called plants. plants could inherit a attribute called name, and perhaps other predefined information from the parent as long as not reasssiged.

  polymorphism
  cars can have different classes. economy, which is fuel efficient, super car hypercar and the like. they would all drive. and have a method called drive. perhaps the method by hypercar would be altered to be called drives really fast. what polymorphism means is that it allows you to reassign the method. also is this an english lesson where you are supposed to provide eytomology

  operator overloading
  you can refer to the same name yet multiple methods, and differnet parameters. it would be like a add operator that can hadle varying length of expressions

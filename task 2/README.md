I chose to us a dictionary data type for the indivudal recipe. The reason for this is you can add key value opiars and update them on the fly it creates an easy format for different data types to be stored.

For the all recipes list I chose a list, the reason being the list supports alphabetical sorting and the data types are all going to be the same.
